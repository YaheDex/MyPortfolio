# MyPortfolio
Welcome to my Github portfolio, in here I'm trying to summarize all the projects I have done during my studying program at ITESM.
# 🧠 My Programming & Engineering Projects

Welcome to my portfolio repository. Here you'll find a curated list of projects I've developed across various technologies and programming languages. Each project highlights a specific area of interest or skillset I've worked on — from systems programming to web development and mobile apps.

Feel free to explore, fork, and reach out if you'd like to collaborate or learn more!

## 📱 Android / Jetpack Compose

Projects focused on Android development using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose for modern UI design.

- [`OcoyucanLens`]((https://github.com/Alvaro3435gg/OcoyoacanLensAndroid)) – An app that mimics the behavior of Google Lens to help to identify the flora of the Ocoyucan zone in Puebla.

## 🧪 Julia

Scientific computing and data-focused projects written in Julia, emphasizing performance and numerical analysis.

- [`WarehouseSolution`](https://github.com/Alvaro3435gg/AlmacenJuliaOpenGL) – Simulation looking for the organizing of boxes in a warehouse using Julia as backend for agent simulation and Python as both frontend to display in a 3d graphic environment the simulation and using 3d-bin-packing library to get the best organization.
- [`CarsAgents`](https://github.com/Alvaro3435gg/cars24JuliaViteReact) – Using Julia for agent simulation, in this case, of cars avoiding the crash between itself, using Julia multiagent libraries and React for the frontend so we could display the entire simulation in a web environment.
- [`Forest`](https://github.com/Alvaro3435gg/forest24502) – Simulating a forest fire using Julia for multiagent simulation and React to do the frontend so the simulation could be friendly visible.

---

## 🧵 Elixir

Functional and concurrent systems built with Elixir and Phoenix Framework.

- [`RealtimeTaxiApp`](https://github.com/TC023/UberV2/tree/main)) – A web-based real-time Uber-like system using Phoenix Channels and Presence.
- [`StrategyPattern`](https://github.com/YaheDex/Strategy_Pattern_A01726980) – Representation of Strategy Pattern using Elixir.

---

## 💻 C++

Low-level and performance-oriented applications written in modern C++.

- [`PymesSolution`](https://github.com/YaheDex/TC1033-E2-Soluci-n-Situaci-n-Problema-) – A C++ program that implements classes to read a txt file to read, store or modify data.
- [`PlagiarismDetector`](https://github.com/YaheDex/PLAGIARISM-DETECTOR-C-) – A plagiarism detector tool implementing Edition distance, Broder contention and Similarity based on common substrings.

---
## 🌐 Web (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

Frontend projects showcasing UI/UX skills, interactivity, and responsive design.

- [`WebPage`](https://github.com/TC023/toposweb) – A webpage made for the social organization ToposFC, with the primary feature of having a calendar for booking visits to a soccer field. Made directly with HTML, JavaScript and CSS.
